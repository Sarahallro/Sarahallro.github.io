When I was a freshman in high school I was invited to go to a science and technology convention, where I first learned about coding. After that I wanted to try it out( it seemed interesting) . Come that summer I started taking some online classes learning Python ... To my  surprise I actually enjoyed it. It was really difficult but there was nothing better than when you finally solve the code you were given to write. When I started sophomore year of high school I made the decision to then attend a C++ class. I was really happy I passed the class ... but not soon I realize even with all those languages, I still didn’t know how to make something out of it. So, the summer of my junior year I applied for Girls Who Code and there I got the amazing opportunity to work on a project with a group of girls  making a website that spread awareness about environmental issues. While in the Girls who Code Program I learned many ways technology was found to be useful and learned many things I hadn’t known about coding before. So basically the reason why I chose to be a software developer was to help find more ways technology can help people wether it be in a day to day bases helping out with the little things that matter or with life changing occurrence that are useful for the long run.
